# Multitasking ESP32 ping class


esp32_ping.hpp is based on [Jaume Oliv√©'s work](https://github.com/pbecchi/ESP32_ping) and [D. Varrels's work](https://github.com/dvarrel) with the following differences:


- Possibility of capturing intermediate ping results.

- Possibility of simultaneous pinging different targets from different tasks.
